# AssettoLog
- AssettoLog is a simple application to log your application data online, or offline.
- AssettoLog as of now is only planned to be compatible with Linux + Proton but will in the future be compatible with Windows systems.
---
### AssettoLog is made of a few parts
- The AssettoLog app in Assetto Corsa showing you your data on your screen
- The simshmbridge which makes it possible to access AC shared memory on linux
- A simple websocket server enabling data exchange between the pc and the phone app
- The phone app receiving and viewing data

Now I know this isn't the brightest README you've read or maybe even the project but it's mine, and idc what you say, except if you want to contribute because then you're **more than welcome to do so!**

### And the only reason I am even doing this project is because:
1. Why not
2. My friend and me need a way to track our sessions n stuff
3. It's a fun project where I can learn how websockets, shared memory and a lot more work.
